# Green Product Ledger

Welcome to the **Green Product Ledger**! This smart contract aims to empower eco-conscious buyers by providing detailed information on the environmental impact of various products. By validating products and offering insights into their eco-friendliness, the Green Product Ledger helps users make informed purchasing decisions, actively reduce their carbon footprint, and raise awareness of products that may be more harmful to the environment.

## üöÄ Project Overview

The Green Product Ledger is actively being developed and improved to best support eco-conscious buyers. The smart contract offers validation and authentication for a wide range of products, assisting users in choosing more sustainable options and minimizing their environmental impact. The ultimate goal is to foster a decentralized platform where buyers are better informed and empowered to make eco-friendly choices.

This project is in its **ground zero** phase, and I welcome contributions from the community to help grow, improve, and refine its features. Contributors can use this contract in their own projects, offer insights, or help raise issues that can be addressed in future updates.
